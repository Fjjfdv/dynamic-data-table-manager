# dynamic-data-table-manager
This is a dynamic data table manager that I built using Next.js, Redux Toolkit, and Material UI. It includes features like customizable columns, CSV import/export, and local state persistence. The goal was to create a flexible and user-friendly interface for managing tabular data.
